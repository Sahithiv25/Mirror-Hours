## 🌟 What Problem Does Mirror Hours Solve?  

> “We have team members in New York, Berlin, and Tokyo. Finding meeting times that don't make someone work at 3 AM is a weekly struggle.”  

Traditional scheduling tools show timezone conversions, but they don't solve the **fundamental problem**:  
✅ Finding overlapping times that respect everyone's work preferences  
✅ Distributing inconvenience fairly
